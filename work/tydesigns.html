    <div class="section__content">
        <p>Not long after realizing that I enjoyed design, coding, and creating website themes, I decided to start doing freelance work
            between schoolwork and other extracurriculars. It mostly remained as an extracurricular rather than a full-fledged business,
            as commissions would mostly be received from friends who were looking for a website. However, occasionally I created web-related
            interfaces for hackathon projects, web apps, and so on.</p>
