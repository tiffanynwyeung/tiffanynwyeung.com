  <div class="section__content">
    <p>I've always been a big fan of recounting the many stories I've shared with my friends â€” namely, the inside jokes that have developed over the years. So I decided to create <i>Remember When</i> as a way for my friends and I to do so online, although now the idea has expanded significantly.</p>
    <p>Incidentally, it was also a great way to practice building and maintaining a Rails app.</p>

  <h1 class="section__title">Design Process.</h1>
  <div class='section__content'>
    <p>My initial design for the web app involved only three components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Post Stream/"Memories"</b>: This app would consist mainly of user-created posts, with a "stream" of items being the main focus on the site. The top-ranked post of the week would be highlighted at the very top of the stream.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Login/Signup</b>: This would sit on the very top of the page. Various methods of displaying these forms were considered, from direct links to a separate page, to links that would create a modal, to having the forms embedded straight on the top of every page. I eventually decided on having a mix of a separate signup page for mobile users, while those on desktops and larger devices could interact with a modal popup instead.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>User Dashboard</b>: This would be the main screen overlay after signin, where a fixed menu bar would sit on the top of the screen. This menu would contain the main functionality of the site, allowing users to create posts, check their score, and so on.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, the most important feature I considered was having the entire site's contents be public, so every post could be seen. But as I kept thinking over the potential use cases, it became apparent that many people would most likely prefer a personalized dashboard, instead of a fully public list of posts from random users. As well, considering how most people would prefer to share posts with friends rather than create fully public posts, I decided to change how the post stream would work: users would be given the ability to create private groups, where people could create a shared memory stream. People could receive invites to these groups using a custom link that was made during the group creation process. Finally, users would instead have the ability to adjust the visibility of their "memories" to either their private stream, or to the general public.</p>
    <p>Of course, this would entail a ton of work, and my main priorities were setting up basic post functionality, signup/login, and the highlighted post feature, as the latter was part of the core concept of this project.</p>
