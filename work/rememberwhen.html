        <p>I've always been a big fan of recounting the many stories I've shared
            with my friends â€” namely, the inside jokes that have developed over
            the years. So I decided to create "Remember When" as a place for my
            friends and I to bring up our inside jokes.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, it was also a great way to practice building and maintaining
            a Rails app.</p>

    <h1 class="section__title">Design Process.</h1>
    <div class='section__content'>
        <p>My initial design for "Remember When" involved only three components.
            The first was a stream of posts, or "memories", with the top-ranked
            post highlighted at the very top of the stream. The second component
             was the login/signup forms, which would sit on the top of the page.
            Finally, there was the user dashboard, which would allow the user to
            create more posts, and check their score. Furthermore, the entire
            site's contents would be public, so every post could be seen.</p>
        <p>However, as I kept thinking over the potential use cases, it became apparent to me
            that many people would most likely prefer a personalized dashboard, instead
            of a fully public list of posts from random users. As well, considering how
            most people would prefer to share posts with friends rather than create
            public posts, I decided to add the ability to create private groups,
            where people could create their own memory stream and share them width
            others using a custom link, as well as the post ability to share to
            their private stream, or to the general public.</p>
