    <h1 class="section__title">Backstory.</h1>
    <div class="section__content">
        <p>A few days after AlphaGo became famous, my close friend <a href="//david-lu.com">David</a> was inspired to create his own version of Go using the language Go... and thus, the idea (and name) of Go Go Go was born.</p>
        <p>A few months later, "Go Go Go" expanded to include several others to work on the API, and David invited me to help create the design of the app's user interface, as well as implement it in React.</p>

        <p>I was tasked with designing the user interface for the web client. This included the public website, signup/login screen, user dashboard, matchmaking queue, and the look of the game itself.</p>
